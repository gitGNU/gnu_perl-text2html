            This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
            please see "t2html.pl --help" for option --script-file
            to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

            XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
            It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
            element and attribute names

            This default CSS2 has been validated according to
            http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

            Comments on the CSS tags:

            -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

            NETSCAPE 4.05

            -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
               font size changes does not show up in screen.
            -  :hover property is not recognised

            NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

            -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
               (IE has no trouble to show it)

            MSIE 4.0+

            - Renders CSS very well.

            Media types

            - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
              the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
              or media "screen"
            - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
              to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
              just define P.column7 { ... }

            The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
            I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

            So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
            (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
            which means both print and scree types.)

                @media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

            To work around that, we separate the definitions with

                P.code { .. }               // For screen

                @media print { P.code      // for printer
                {
                    ..
                }}

            And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

        This page describes Technical text (TF) format and a Perl script
        which can convert TF to HTML.


<P class="column8">
        <SPAN class="word-ref">[Sourceforge perl-text2html project public summary]</SPAN> Perl
        text2html is HTML 4.01/CSS2 project which converts pure
        plain text files into very informative and professional looking
        HTML documentation pages. The text files require no mark up
        whatsoever, just naturally written text in Technical Format
        (TF).

      1.2 Description
      
  </H2>




        Writing text documents is different from writing messages to
        Usenet or to your fellow workers. There already exists several
        tools to convert email messages into HTML, like <EM class="word">MHonArc</EM>,
        Email hyper archiver, but for regular text documents, like for
        memos, FAQs, help pages and for other papers, there wasn't
        any suitable HTML converter couple of years back. The author
        wanted a simple HTML tool which would read <STRONG class="word">pure</STRONG> <STRONG class="word">plain</STRONG>
        <STRONG class="word">text</STRONG> documents, like guides, tips pages, documentation,
        book mark pages etc. and convert them into HTML. Here you will
        find the specification how to format your text documents for
        <EM class="word">t2html.pl</EM> perl script text to HTML converter.


<P class="column8">
        Few arguments, why plain text is the best source document format:

<UL>
	<LI>It is readable by all, without any extra software
	<LI>Deliverable by email, as is.
	<LI>Most easily kept in version control
	<LI>Most easily patched ( when someone sends a diff -u ...)
	<LI>Most easily handed to someone else when author no longer
            maintain it. (If you have specialized tools, people
	            need to learn them in order to maintain your FAQ.)
</UL>




<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.2.1 Overview of features:</STRONG></EM>


<UL>
	<LI>Requires Perl 5.004 or never
	<LI>500K text document takes 70 seconds to convert to HTML.
	<LI>TF to Perl POD conversion may be in a future plan.
	<LI>Better linking of multiple files planned
	<LI>Configuration file for individual file options planned.
</UL>




<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.2.2 HTML conversion</STRONG></EM>


<UL>
	<LI>minimal mark up: rendering is based on indentation level.
            Written text document looks like a &quot;Natural Document&quot;, and is
            suitable for reading as such.
	<LI>Text layout with indentation rules is called Technical Format
            (TF) and document must be formatted according to it before it
            is suitable for HTML generation.
	<LI>Rules are simple: place heading to the left and text at column 8.
	<LI>Program generates <EM class="word">META</EM> tags for search engines.
	<LI>Colored html page: &lt;EM&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;PRE&gt; ...
	<LI>Hyperlinks and email addresses are automatically detected.
	            No mark up is needed.
</UL>




<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.2.3 HTML 4.01</STRONG></EM>


<UL>
	<LI>Make a single html (1 file) or <EM class="word">Frame</EM> version (3 files)
	<LI>Sample CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheet) included in HTML code for
	            document rendering. User can import his own CSS2.
</UL>




<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.2.4 Link check for the text file</STRONG></EM>


<UL>
	<LI>You need LWP module in order to use this feature. (Comes with
            latest Perl)
	<LI>Program has switches to run Link check on your text file
            to find out any broken or moved link. Currently you
            have to manually fix the links, nut an Emacs mode to do this
            automatically is planned. The output from Link check is standard
	            grep style:  <EM class="word">FILE:NBR:Error-Description</EM>
</UL>




<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.2.5 Splitting the text file to pieces</STRONG></EM>


<UL>
	<LI>You can split very large document into pieces, e.g. according
            to top level headings and convert each piece to HTML. This is
            also handy if you're planning to print Slides for a class:
            Split on Headings to individual files: raise the font point
	            and print each file separately.

        You need nothing else but a text editor where the current column

<P class="column8">
        If word <SAMP class="word">Emacs</SAMP> means anything to you, then you can use additional

        writing much more easier: It will help formatting paragraphs,
        filling bullets numbering headings and keeping TOC up to date. The
        description of the Emacs package is found from this page and from
        the package itself.

      1.6 Ripping program documentation
      
  </H2>





<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.6.1 Documentation tools in programming languages</STRONG></EM>



<P class="column8">
        <EM class="word">Perl</EM> is an exception within programmin languages, because it
        includes internal documentation syntax called <STRONG class="word">POD</STRONG> (Plain Old
        Syntax), with which you can embed documentation right into
        the program source. Deriving the documentation from perl
        programs is a straightforward job.


<P class="column8">
        Another well known language (invented long after Perl) is
        Java, which calls the embedded documentation <EM class="word">javadoc</EM>.


<P class="column8">
        All others, the de facto method would be:

<P class="column7"><EM><STRONG>
       1.6.2 Other programming languages</STRONG></EM>



<P class="column8">
        But it is possible to embed documentation inside any
        programming language: directly into the code. Another small
        Perl utility is used to extract the documentation provided it
        was written in TF format. Documentation is put at the
        beginning of the file and updated there.


<P class="column8">
        <SAMP class="word">ripdoc.pl</SAMP> extracts the documentation which follows TF
        guidelines. The idea is that you can generate HTML documents from
        the embedded 'TF pod'. The conversion goes like this:


<PRE class="code">
      % ripdoc.pl code.sh | t2html.pl &gt; code.html
      % ripdoc.pl code.el | t2html.pl &gt; code.html
      % ripdoc.pl code.cc | t2html.pl &gt; code.html</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        Suitable for awk, shell, sh, ksh, C++, Java, Lisp, python,
        Tcl etc. programming languages. The only criteria is that the language
        supports <EM class="word">one-comment-starter</EM> and that the documentation has
        been written by using it. Languages that have <EM class="word">comment-start</EM>
        and <EM class="word">comment-end</EM>, like C that has /* and */, are not suitable for
        ripdoc.pl. Visit

            html2texi converts HTML documentation trees into Texinfo
            format.  Texinfo format can be easily converted to Info format
            (for browsing in Emacs or the stand alone Info browser), to a
            printed manual, or to HTML. Thus, html2texi.pl permits
            conversion of HTML files to Info format, and secondarily
            enables producing printed versions of Web page
            hierarchies. Unlike HTML, Info format is searchable. Since Info
            is integrated into Emacs, one can read documentation without
            starting a separate Web browser. Additionally, Info browsers
            (including Emacs) contain convenient features missing from Web
	            browsers, such as easy index lookup and mouse-free browsing.

<P class="column8">
        Hyperlatex is a package that allows you to prepare documents
        in HTML, and, at the same time, to produce a neatly printed
        document from your input. Unlike some other systems that you
        may have seen, Hyperlatex is not a general LaTeX-to-HTML
        converter. In my eyes, conversion is not a solution to HTML
        authoring. A well written HTML document must differ from a
        printed copy in a number of rather subtle ways. I doubt that
        these differences can be recognized mechanically, and I
        believe that converted LaTeX can never be as readable as a
        document written in HTML.  The basic idea of Hyperlatex is to
        make it possible to write a document that will look like a
        flawless LaTeX document when printed and like a handwritten
        HTML document when viewed with an HTML browser.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;< conversion.txt
        html2texi converts HTML documentation trees into Texinfo format.
        Texinfo format can be easily converted to Info format (for browsing
        in Emacs or the stand alone Info browser), to a printed manual, or
        to HTML. Thus, html2texi.pl permits conversion of HTML files to
        Info format, and secondarily enables producing printed versions of
        Web page hierarchies. Unlike HTML, Info format is searchable. Since
        Info is integrated into Emacs, one can read documentation without
        starting a separate Web browser. Additionally, Info browsers
        (including Emacs) contain convenient features missing from Web
        browsers, such as easy index lookup and mouse-free browsing.

      2.1 Preface, Jan 1997
      
  </H2>




        Late in the 1996 I seemed to have a need for a better text file
        handling than just plan <SAMP class="word">text-mode</SAMP>. I was looking for a simple
        tool to generate HTML pages out of text-based documents. After some
        researching on the web, I still coudn't find anything that would
        have been strictly text-based solution. There were many &quot;languages&quot;
        from which the HTML could be generated, but really, I dind't want
        to learn any new language just for that. I can understand people
        that write their documents still using LaTeX, but uhm, Win32 Word
        is much suitable and more known than any of those exotic formats.
        The project started by creating the tool that converted text into
        HTML (Perl t2html.pl script) and then writing a Emacs package to
        help writing the text files. It has been proven to be really nice
        combination where flexibility meets cross-platform demends.

      2.2 Overview of features
      
  </H2>




        The text layout you write

<UL>
	<LI>You write text in rigid format called 'Technical'
	<LI>There are only two heading levels, one at column 0, and
            another at column 4. NO OTHER SUB-HEADINGS SUPPORTED.
	<LI>Text is written at column 8, at the first standard tab position.
	<LI>Each column has different meaning how text is intepreted
            into html with t2html.pl perl script.
	<LI>The full 'Technical text format' is described in the
            function description of <SAMP class="word">tinytf-mode</SAMP>. The most recent description
            is always described in the perl program t2html.pl --help
	<LI>The is only a handful, natural, markup conventions for PLAIN TEXT.
            The whole idea was that you do not need to learn any
            markup language, but just write standard looking text, which is
            easily managed and edited with any editor. In addition diff(1),
            pathc(19 and cvs(1) are the most effective tools to keep your
            &quot;text&quot; document project in condition and encourage others to
	            contribute fixes to your text files.
</UL>




<P class="column8">
        This package

<UL>
	<LI>Can show text in outline style manner: you can open and close
            headings.
	<LI>Provides commands to move among headings easily.
	<LI>Capitalizes heading with one command.
	<LI>Numbers headings with one command.
	<LI>Text is untabified in regular intervals.
	<LI>On-line help in 19.30+. It assist you writing the text
            by displaying message in echo area: how the text is intepreted by
            t2html.pl program, that is, how the text woudl look in html.
	<LI>Offer functions to mark text with special text MARKERS that
            would produce &lt;STRONG&gt; or &lt;EMP&gt; and the like in the html.
	<LI>A function is added to <SAMP class="word">find-file-hooks</SAMP> which will turn on
            the `tinytf-mode` if file contents look like it has been been
	            written in Techical Format.

      2.3 What is 'Technical format'?
      
  </H2>




        In short: it is list of text placement and formatting rules.
        And you're looking at it right now in this document.


<P class="column8">
        This package offers minor mode for text files and helps you to
        maintain correct layout. You can even convert file into html very
        easily with the perl script which is usually distributed in the
        complete Tiny Tools Kit or available separatedly from the CPAN
        under developer account JARIAALTO. You do not need to know a shred
        about the html language itself. And it is much easier to update
        text files, than deal with html itself. When you have text ready,
        you just feed it to the t2html.pl perl script and it gives you
        nicely formatted html page. Writing html <EM class="word">home</EM> pages is different
        story, because you usually want to cinlude some graphics,
        javascript, PHP or JSP in the page. But putting some text document
        available in html format is easily made possible with this package.


<P class="column8">
        In the other hand, while you may not be interested in html, you
        could still consider writing your documents in 'Technical format'
        &ndash; with word <EM class="word">technical</EM> I refer to the layout of the text, which
        is very <STRONG class="word">rigid</STRONG>. In order to use facilities in this package,
        eg. heading hiding/showing, the headings must be placed in
        columns 0 and 4 and the first word must be in <EM class="word">uppercase</EM>.  The
        actual text you write starts at column 8.


<P class="column8">
        If you decide write text like this, you become accustomed to the
        layout very quickly and it also helps keeping your documents in
        the same format.


<P class="column8">
        All in all, this package was primarily designed to help writing
        text documents for <SAMP class="word">t2html.pl</SAMP> and viewing document in <EM class="word">outline</EM>
        styled selective display. Please refer to mode description for
        full details of the text layout format.

      2.5 How do you write text
      
  </H2>




        This package turns on two minor modes: <SAMP class="word">tinytab-mode</SAMP>, that handles
        your TAB key movements and <SAMP class="word">tinytf-mode</SAMP>, the Technical format
        minor mode. If you're uncertain about how the column will be
        treated in html output, call following function. If you have 19.30+
        this is not necessary, see note about post command above.


<P class="column10"><EM class="quote10">
          Do you wonder why 'z' prefix is default? Well, I wanted a fast
          key that was mostly unused. You can change that if you prefer
          some other key. See variable <SAMP class="word">tinytf-:mode-prefix-key</SAMP></EM>



<PRE class="code">
      z RET   tinytf-column-info-display</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        Normal text you write as usual, but if you want to mark regions
        as &quot;quotations&quot; or &quot;code examples&quot; there is appropriate indent
        commands


<PRE class="code">
      z /     tinytf-indent-region-text
      z '     tinytf-indent-region-quote
      z ;     tinytf-indent-region-sample
      z :     tinytf-indent-region-strong

      z t     tinytf-indent-paragraph-text
      z a     tinytf-indent-paragraph-text-as-is
      z l     tinytf-indent-paragraph-text-and-fill
      z q     tinytf-indent-paragraph-quote
      z Q     tinytf-indent-paragraph-quote-and-fill
      z s     tinytf-indent-paragraph-sample
      z 0     tinytf-indent-paragraph-zero</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        The <SAMP class="word">tinytf-indent-paragraph-text-as-is</SAMP> is a bit special, because
        it won't fill the text while it moves the paragraph to the text
        position. Instead it adds symbolic &lt;BR&gt; codes to the front of every
        moved line. In html this ensures that the lines will be shown
        exactly as you see them. See also BR mark commands.


<P class="column8">
        There is no functions for bullet creation, because you can write
        them easily by hand. Use <SAMP class="word">z</SAMP> <SAMP class="word">b</SAMP> to fill bullet text nicely
        and consider using <EM class="word">filladapt.el</EM>. Bullets look like this


<PRE class="code">
      o   This is bullet..
          and cont'd line here
      o   Yet another buller
          and cont'd line here</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        The <SAMP class="word">tinytab-mode</SAMP> will advance your tab key by 4 every time, so
        the text in the bullets go to the right column (12). Remeber also
        to keep the <SAMP class="word">tinytab-return-key-mode</SAMP> on, because that continues
        lines as they were written above when you press return. See also
        bullet conversion command, which reformats previous text that used
        dashes(-) to separate bullets.

      2.6 BR marking commands
      
  </H2>




        In Html, the text would normally wrap according to the borwser's
        page width. But sometimes you may wish to tell exactly that
        it shouldn't wrap the lines according to browser. For example
        if you want to include a quoted text &quot;as is&quot; from the usenet
        posts to your page, you need o add symbolic BR code to the beginning
        of each line. Like including the following quotation


<PRE class="code">
      &gt;&gt;Jim has a good point here...
      &gt;&gt;I would have expected that the symstem depends on..
      &gt;Yeah; but you hadn't looked at the /usr/adm/today.log
      &gt;</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        In order to add this to your page &quot;as is&quot;; you can do this:
        indent it as &quot;Sample&quot; and it will automatically show like that.
        But normally you want it to show as quoted text where you refer.
        Then you do:


<PRE class="code">
      z Q         tinytf-indent-paragraph-quote
      z m b       tinytf-mark-br-paragraph</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        Which will prepend dot-code(.) to the front of every line.
        You can also add the <EM class="word">dot-code</EM> by yourself or use following
        command


<PRE class="code">
      z m B       tinytf-mark-br-line</PRE>

      2.7 Heading writing and handling
      
  </H2>




        You can only use 2 heading levels, which normally suffices.  Sorry,
        there is no support for more deeper headings. You start headings
        with big letters or number at column 0 or 4. Here is some
        specialized commands for headings.


<P class="column8">
        This one converts first character of each heading to
        uppercase. This fixes mistakenly left lowercase letters.


<PRE class="code">
      z f h     tinytf-heading-fix

      before command:
      heading
          heading

      after command:
      Heading
          Heading</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        You can (re)number heading easily with following command. If
        there is no number in the line, one is added to the beginning of
        heading. And if you have added new heading somewhere in the
        middle of text, just call this function and it renumbers all
        headings again. Running command with <EM class="word">prefix</EM> <EM class="word">arg</EM> removes
        numbering.


<PRE class="code">
      z f 0     tinytf-heading-numbering

      before command:
      heading
          heading
      heading
          heading

      after command:
      1.0 heading
          1.1 heading
      2.0 heading
          2.1 heading</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        One note about renumbering. Some people write heading number so
        that they are closed with parenthesis. This style is not
        recommended with technical format style and when you do renumber,
        those parenthesis will be removed. The parenthesis style is not
        supported because the plain number style is more easily parsed
        and detected. In addition, the palin-number style in headings is
        more widely used in the world.

      About table of contents
      
  </H2>




        When you write text, you don't write the table of contents, but
        the headings. Be sure to add heading &quot;Table of contents&quot; somewhere
        in the document. To generate table of contents use commands:


<PRE class="code">
      z T             tinytf-toc, Try with C-u argument too
      z mouse-1       tinytf-toc-mouse</PRE>

      2.9 Selective display
      
  </H2>




        The hiding and showing of the headings and their text is done by
        using the outline/folding style display. There is no magic in this;
        but there is two interesting commands that you can use in any
        selective display buffer.


<PRE class="code">
      z C-p     Prints selctive display (what you actually see)
      z C-c     Copy selective display</PRE>

      2.10 Word about key definitions when mode is turned on
      
  </H2>




        When the minor mode is active it overrides some commonly used
        keybindings and moves their original function under Control key.
        For example:


<PRE class="code">
      original PgUp    --&gt; Now Control-PgUp
      original PgDown  --&gt; Now Control-PgDown

      PgUp             --&gt; Moving heading backward
      DownUp           --&gt; Moving heading forward</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        If you are using X envinronment or your emacs recognizes mouse,
        then there is one handy binding that opens or closes heading
        levels when you click over them.


<PRE class="code">
      [mouse-3]       tinytf-mouse-context-sensitive</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        If you press this mouse button anywhere else than over the
        headings, it'll call original binding. This feature is similar as
        what is used in folding.el

      2.11 Technical note: about the outline layout
      
  </H2>




        Speed was my primary goal when I added the outline code. But that
        came with a price: I would have liked that the Heading-1 were
        separated by at least one empty space so that the buffer would
        look visually better.


<PRE class="code">
      heading1-1
          heading1-1
          heading1-2
                                  &lt;&lt; empty space here
      heading2-1
          heading2-1
          heading2-2</PRE>


<P class="column8">
        But that would have required adding some extra code to do bound
        checking every time the block is collapsed/opened. Currently I'm
        not going to add that checking because it would reduce speed and
        the check would cause unnecessary complexity to current code
        flow.


<P class="column8">
        If I have time, I may take a look at that more. For now, please
        try to bear the spartan look of the outlined headings.


<P class="column8">
        A patch is appreciated which would correct the &quot;spartan&quot; look. Also
        check that the performance isn't decreased much with elp.el. [Yes,
        the performance matters very much: the files managed in
       2.11.4 TF format are as big as 700K - 1Meg.]</STRONG></EM>

      2.12 Technical note: default prefix key 'z'
      
  </H2>




        The prefix key definition is on <SAMP class="word">tinytf-:mode-prefix-key</SAMP> That is
        currently &quot;z&quot; by default. If you type &quot;zz&quot;, you get plain &quot;z&quot;. I
        wanted to choose fast key and avoind wrist pain as much as
        possible. When you write TF text, you use this mode a lot and
        accessing commands should be easy too.

      2.13 Technical note: post command
      
  </H2>




        This note is valid only for old Emacs releases, prior 20.x.


<P class="column8">
        While you type text in the buffer, the post command activates at
        regular intervals to untabify the buffer. The untabify is done
        because it makes formatting text easier and when you print the text
        file, you can be sure that the output is the same regardless of
        the tabs.


<P class="column8">
        If you have Emacs 19.30+ there is additional help feature available
        to you. When you sit still in some column position for few seconds,
        the column description will be shown automatically. That should
        help keeping you informed of the text layout.

        Two external utilitis are searched for HTML generation:

  </H2>




        In Emacs 20.6 the TinyTf pulldown menu contains bolded tites
        for certain sections. This gets almost always garbled with
        the first pull-down. Selecting the menu second time shows
        correct section names with bold letters.
