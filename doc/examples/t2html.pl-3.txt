        #T2HTML-METADESCRIPTION This is test page of tool t2html.pl

        This is a sampler of a text file used to generate HTML when
        processed with a supporting perl script. The t2html project is
        hosted at http://perl-text2html.sourcefoge.net/ and Emacs add-on
        package tinytf.el at http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.com/

    Headings

        The tool provides for two heading levels. Combined with
        bullets and numbered lists, it ought to be enough for most
        purposes, unless you really like section 1.2.5.3.4.

        You can insert links to headings or other documents. The
        convention is interior links are made by joining the first
        four words of the heading with underscores, so they must be
        unique. A link to a heading below looks like this in the text
        document and generates the link shown. There also is syntax
        for automatically inserting a base URL (see the tool
        documentation).

        The following blue link is generated with markup code:
        # REF tinytest-body.html#markup ;(Markup);

        #REF #line_breaking ;(Line breaking);

    Markup

        The markup here is mostly based on column position, meaning
        mostly no tags. The exceptions are special marks for bullets
        and for emphasis. See later sections for the effects of column
        position on the output HTML.

        .Text surrounded by equals comes out =another= =color=
        .Text surrounded by backquote/forward quote comes out `color'
        .Text surrounded by asterisks comes out *italic* *text*
        .Text surrounded by underscores comes out _bold_
        .The long dash -- is signified with two consequent dashes (-)
        .The plus-minus is signified with (+) and (-) markers combined +-4
        .Copyright sign (C) is big character "C" in parentheses
        .Registered trade mark sign (R) is big character "R" in parentheses
        .Euro sign is small character "e" right after digit: 400e
        .Degree sign is number "0" in parentheses: 5(0)C
        .Superscript is marked with bracket immediately attached to text[see this]
        .Special HTML entities can embedded in a normal way, like: &times; &lt; &gt; &le; &ge; &ne; &radic; &minus; &alpha; &beta; &gamma; &#402; &divide; &laquo; &raquo; - &ndash; &mdash; &asymp; &equiv; &lsaquo; &rsaquo; &sum; &infin; &trade;


    Emacs minor mode

        If you use the advertised Emacs minor mode (tinytf.el) you can
        easily renumber headings as you revise the text. Test is also
        colorized as you edit content.

        The editing mode can automatically generate the table of
        contents and the HTML generator can use it to generate a two
        frame output with the TOC in the left frame as hotlinks to the
        sections and subsections. Visit http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.net

    Bullets, lists, and links

        This is ordinary text.

        o   This is a bullet paragraph with a continuation mark
            (leading comma) in the last line. It will not work if the
            ,comma is on the same line as the bullet.

            This is a continued bullet paragraph. You use a leading
            comma in the last line of the previous block to make a
            continued item. This is ok except the paragraph fill code
            (for the previous paragraph) cannot deal with it. Maybe
            it is a hint not to do continued bullets, or a hint not to
            put the comma in until you are done formatting.

        o   The next bullet text text text text text text text text
            text text text text text text text text text text text
            text text text text text text text text text text text
            text text

        .   This is a numbered list, made with a '.' in column 8 of its
            first line and text in column 12. You may not have blank
            lines between the items.
        .   Clickable email <gork@ork.com>.
        .   Non-clickable email gork@ork.com.
        .   Clickable link: http://this.com
        .   Non-clickable link: -http://this.com.
        .   Clickable file: file:/home/gork/x.txt.

    Line breaking

        Ordinary text with leading '.' forces line breaks in the
        .HTML.
        .Here is a broken line.
        Here is another.

    Specials

        You can use superscripts[1], multiple[(2)] and almost
        any[(abc)] and imaginable[IV superscripts]

Samples per column (heading level h1)

        These samples show the range of effects produced by writing
        text beginning in different columns.  The column numbers
        referred to are columns in the source text, not (obviously)
        the output. The column numbering is counted starting from 0,
        _not_ _number_ _1_.

 Column 1, is undefined and nothing special.

  Column 2, is undefined and nothing special.

   Column 3, plain text, with color

    Column 4, Next heading level (h2)

     Column 5, plain text, with color

      Column 6, This i used for long quotations. The text uses
      Georgia font, which is designed for web, but which is
      equally good for laser printing font.

       Column 7, bold, italic

       "Column 7, start and end with double quote. Use for inner TOPICS"

        Column 8, standard text _strong_ *emphasized*

         Column 9, font weight bold, not italic.

          Column 10, quotation text, italic serif. This text has been made a
          little smaller and condensed than the rest of the text.
          More quotation text. More quotation text. More quotation text.
          More quotation text. More quotation text. More quotation text.
          More quotation text. More quotation text. More quotation text.
          More quotation text. More quotation text. More quotation text.

           Column 11, another color, for questions, exercise texts etc.

            Note: It is possible to say something important at
            column 12, which is normally reserved for CODE.
            You must supply options --css-code-bg and
            --css-code-note=Note:

        Here is the code column 12:

            Note: Here is something important to tell you about this code
            This part of the text in first paragraph is rendered differently,
            because it started with magic word `Note:'. The rest of the
            paragraphs are rendered as CODE.

            /* Column 12 code */
            /* 10pt courier navy */
            // column 12 and beyond stay as is to preserve code formatting.

            for( i=0 ; i < 10 ; i++ )
            {
                more();
                whatever();
            }

        More column 8 regular text. The normal text paragraphs are at
        standard tab position.

    Another level 2 heading (column 4)

        Here is more ordinary text.

Table rendering examples

        These examples make sense only if the options *--css-code-bg*
        (use gray background for column 12) and
        *--css-code-note=Note:* have been turned on. If orfer to take
        full advantage of all the possibilities, you should introduce
        yourself to the HTML 4.01 specification and peek the CSS code
        in the generated HTML: the *tableclass* can take an attribute
        of the embedded default styles.

            Note: This is example 1 and `--css-code-note' options
            reads 'First word' in paragraph at column 12 and
            renders it differently. You can attache code right after
            this note, which must occupy only one paragraph

            --css-code-note=REGEXP      Regexp matches 'First word'
            --css-code-bg

        Here is example 2 using table control code
        #t2html::tableborder:1

            #t2html::tableborder:1

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

        Here is example 3 using table control code
        #t2html::td:bgcolor=#FFEEFF:tableclass:solid

            #t2html::td:bgcolor=#FFEEFF:tableclass:solid

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

        Here is example 4 using table control code
        #t2html::td:bgcolor=#CCFFCC

            #t2html::td:bgcolor=#CCFFCC

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

        Here is example 5 using table control code
        #t2html::td:bgcolor=#FFFFFF:tableclass:dashed

            #t2html::td:bgcolor=#FFFFFF:tableclass:dashed

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

        Here is example 6 using multiple table control codes. Use underscore sccharacter
        to separate different table attributes from each other. The underscore will
        be vconverted into SPACE. The double quotes around the VALUE are not
        strictly required by HTML standard, but they are expected in
        XML. Color #FFFFFF" means "no-color".
        #t2html::td:bgcolor="#FFFFFF":table:border=1_border=0_cellpadding="10"_cellspacing="0"

            #t2html::td:bgcolor="#FFFFFF":table:border=1_border=0_cellpadding="10"_cellspacing="0"

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

        Here is example 7 using table control code
        #t2html::td:class=color-navy:table:cellpadding=0 which cancels
        default grey coloring. The cellpadding must be zeroed, because
        the color "fringe" is no longer around the text to make room.

            #t2html::td:class=color-white:table:cellpadding=0

            for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
            {
                //  Doing something in this loop
            }

Embedding HTML codes directly

        It's also possible to embed HTML into text directly by writing
        all HTML together (no newlines allowed!) and doubling every
        HTML element with two (<<) and (>>) marks. Below you see table
        that was generated using pure HTML code. See the source file
        how this example looks in real text format.

        In bash programming there are various shell variables:

<<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10">>
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>> $0
            <<TD>> The name the script was invoked with. This may be a
            basename without directory component, or a path name. This
            variable is not changed with subsequent shift commands.
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>> $1, $2, $3, ...
            <<TD>> The first, second, third, ... command line argument,
            respectively. The argument may contain whitespace if the argument
            was quoted, i.e. "two words".
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>> $#
            <<TD>> Number of command line arguments, not counting
            the invocation name $0
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>> $#
            <<TD>> Number of command line arguments, not counting
            the invocation name $0
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>>More cells Could be here.
        <<TR align="left">>
            <<TD>>And even more cells here.

Conversion program

        The perl program t2html.pl turns the raw technical text format
        into HTML. Among other things it can produce HTML files with
        an index frame, a main frame, and a master that ties the two
        together. It has features too numerous to list to control the
        output. For details see the perldoc than is embedded inside the
        program:

            perl -S t2html.pl --help | more

        The framed HTML pages are generated with option *--html-frame*.
