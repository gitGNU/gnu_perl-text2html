        This is INSTALL file of Perl Text to HTML project

Requirements

        GNU make is needed for the `Makefile'. To check which version you
        have, run:

            foo@host:/home/foo$ make -v
            GNU Make 3.80
            ...

        Perl 5.004 or later is needed for the program. If option
        --link-check is used, then extra modules from CPAN are needed
        To check the perl version:

            foo@host:/home/foo$ perl -v
            This is perl, v5.8.5
            ...

        Try see if the necessary modules to check URLs links are
        installed:

            foo@host:/home/foo$ perl -MHTML::FormatText -e 'print ok'
            foo@host:/home/foo$ perl -MHTML::Parse      -e 'print ok'
            foo@host:/home/foo$ perl -MLWP::UserAgent   -e 'print ok'

How to install

        Perl is supposed to be in /usr/bin/perl and if it is not
        there you may want to create a symlink (if you're admin):

            ln -s `which perl` /usr/bin/perl

        Installation requires GNU make. The default locations are
        /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man for system wide install:

            su - root
            make install

        To install for local account only, use:

            make DESTDIR=$HOME install

Examples

        It is best to start with the manual page which is same as option
        `--help' and jump to the end for examples. But the quickest way
        may be just try what the program can do by using this INSTALL
        file as an example (the layout you see is what you get):

            t2html.pl INSTALL | lynx
